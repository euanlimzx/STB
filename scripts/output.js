Development Expenditure excludes land-related expenditure from FY2001.\r\n\r\nOperating Expenditure refers to expenditure on manpower, other operating expenditure (excluding expenses on investment and agency fees on land sales), operating grants and transfers. \r\n\r\nRefinements have been made over time to the sectoral classification of Ministries' expenditure to better reflect the nature of the programmes. In FY2007, expenditure by the then-Ministry of Communications, Information and the Arts under the Info-Communications and Media Development Programme was reclassified from the Social Development sector to the Economic Development sector. In FY2013, expenditure by the Ministry of Manpower under the Financial Security programme was reclassified from the Economic Development sector to the Social Development sector. \r\n\r\nWith effect from 1 November 2012, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA) were restructured to form three Ministries: (i) MCYS was renamed the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), (ii) MICA was renamed the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and (iii) the new Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) was formed to undertake functions transferred from MCYS and MICA.

In FY2013, expenditure by the Ministry of Manpower under the Financial Security programme was reclassified from the Economic Development sector to the Social Development sector.\r\n\r\nWith effect from 1 November 2012, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA) were restructured to form three Ministries: (i) MCYS was renamed the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), (ii) MICA was renamed the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and (iii) the new Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) was formed to undertake functions transferred from MCYS and MICA.",

The data for SMU's courses is displayed in two categories: (i) overall results for all graduates within the course regardless of the award they attained, and (ii) results for the graduates awarded Cum Laude and above.  Should the graduates undertake more than one Degree (e.g. Dual Degree programme), they have been classified based on their first Degree.\r\n\r\n^  Data is based on a sample size of fewer than 30 respondents.\r\n\r\n\\**  No data is shown due to the small number of graduates and/or low response rates.\r\n\r\n\\#  Data on Law, Medical, Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences & Chinese Medicine graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated one year ago (e.g. for 2018 GES survey, data is obtained from 2017 graduates) after they have completed their one-year practical law course/pupillage/housemanship/first-year residency/practical training.  Data on Architecture graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 3 years ago (e.g. for 2018 GES survey, data is obtained from 2015 graduates) after they have completed their practical training.\r\n\r\n^^  Data includes the employment figures of graduates from Bachelor of Engineering (Bioengineering), which was merged into Bachelor of Engineering (Biomedical Engineering) in 2014.\r\n\r\n\\##  Data on NTU’s Medicine graduates will be obtained from a follow-up survey on the graduates after they have completed their housemanship/first-year residency.\r\n\r\n\\###  Data on SUTD's Bachelor of Science (Architecture and Sustainable Design) graduates will be obtained from a follow-up survey on the graduates after they have completed their practical training.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n**Disclaimer:**  \r\nThe data published is provided on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind.

    "description": "Source : Derived based on data from Central Provident Fund Board\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",

The development charge has been reclassified from the 'Other Fees and Charges' to 'Other Taxes' category with effect from April 2009 to more accurately reflect its nature as a tax under Section 35 of the Planning Act.\r\n\r\nOther Fees and Charges include Licenses, Permits, Service Fees, Sales of Goods, Rental of Premises, Fines and Forfeitures and Reimbursements.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Constitutional amendments to protect 50% of Net Investment Income in FY2000, interest on development loans was classified as ‘Others’.",

Data from the Population Censuses and General Household Surveys are not comparable to the other years due to differences in coverage and methodology.\r\n\r\nLiteracy Rate - Data for 1970 pertain to total population aged 15 years and over.  From 1980 onwards, data pertain to residents aged 15 years and over.  \r\n\r\nCombined Gross Enrolment Ratio - Data for 1970 pertain to total enrolment and total population.  From 2005 onwards, data coverage includes resident students enrolled in private educational institutions.  From 2010 onwards, the gross enrolment ratios are adjusted for residents who are based overseas and cannot be enrolled in Singapore.\r\n\r\nResident Labour Force Participation Rate (15 Years & Over), Proportion of Employed Residents Aged 15 Years & Over - Data for 1970 pertain to total population aged 15 years and over.  Data for 2007 have been adjusted based on latest revised population estimates from DOS to facilitate comparisons with 2008 onwards.\r\n\r\nProportion of PMETs Among Employed Residents Aged 15 Years & Over - Data for 1970 pertain to all employed persons aged 10 years and over.  For 1970, data are classified according to the Standard Classification of Occupations, Singapore, 1969.  For 1980, data are classified according to the Singapore Standard Occupational Classification (SSOC) 2000.  Data for 1990, 1995, 2000-2005, 2007-2015 were mapped to SSOC 2015 as far as possible to facilitate data comparability.  2006 data are not available as the level of occupational detail collected in 2006 did not support mapping.  Data for 2007 have been adjusted based on latest revised population estimates from DOS to facilitate comparisons with 2008 onwards.\"\r\n",

Estate duty, which is a tax on the total market value of a person's assets (cash and non-cash) at the date of his or her death, has been removed for deaths occurring on and after 15 February 2008. \r\n\r\nTaxes on Motor Vehicles comprise additional registration fees, road tax, special tax on heavy-oil engines, passenger vehicle seating fees and non-motor vehicle licences, but exclude excise duties on motor vehicles which are classified under Customs and Excise Duties. \r\n\r\nWith effect from March 2010, Betting Taxes include casino tax collected under Section 146 of the Casino Control Act. \r\n\r\nOther Taxes include the foreign worker levy, annual tonnage tax, water conservation tax and development charge. The development charge has been reclassified from the 'Other Fees and Charges' to 'Other Taxes' category with effect from April 2009 to more accurately reflect its nature as a tax under Section 35 of the Planning Act.\r\n\r\nOther Fees and Charges include Licenses, Permits, Service Fees, Sales of Goods, Rental of Premises, Fines and Forfeitures and Reimbursements.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Constitutional amendments to protect 50% of Net Investment Income in FY2000, interest on development loans was classified as ‘Others’.",

Since 2008, Subject-based Banding was introduced for the Primary 5 cohort and streaming was removed. With Subject-based Banding, students are able to offer a mix of Standard or Foundation level subjects depending on their aptitude in each subject.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"",

Chargeable income is zero if total deduction is more than total income.\r\n* Taxable Group means those companies with net tax payable after taking into account allowable tax credits, tax remission, tax rebates and tax deducted at source. \r\n* There will be differences between the Net Tax Assessed (NTA) and the Tax Collection published on data.gov.sg. NTA is the net tax assessed to be payable or repayable by an entity after taking into account allowable tax credits, tax remission, tax rebates and tax deducted at source, for a specific tax period. This might be different from the amount of tax collected as the taxes could be collected or refunded across different Financial Years (FY) due to taxpayers paying their taxes via GIRO instalments or having their past years’ assessments reviewed.",

It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",

It does not cover HDB flats. \r\n\r\nThe rental index is computed from information obtained in returns filed with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).  When a property is let out, the property owner has to inform IRAS the details of the tenancy agreement. Besides an overall rental index for private residential properties, sub-indices for landed and non-landed properties are also compiled. From the 2015-Q1, a “stratified hedonic regression methodology” is used to compute the rental indices. Under this method, variations in the attributes of rental private properties transacted such as age and unit size are controlled for by using hedonic regression and rental movements are aggregated using 5-quarter fixed weights to derive the aggregate rental change.",

The issue was rectified in Jun 2023 and ACRA has since resumed the standard processing time for striking off applications.  This has consequential effect on the published cessation statistics from Jul to Nov 2023.  Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the implementation of Circuit Breaker in Singapore from 7 Apr to 1 Jun 2020, ACRA had extended the time for relevant parties to respond to notices for the striking off applications by companies and limited liability partnerships.  This has a consequential effect on the published cessation statistics for Aug to Oct 2020.  ACRA has since resumed the standard processing time for striking off applications.  The statistics on business entities cessation till 2017 have been adjusted to provide a more accurate reflection of the underlying cessation trends.  In 2016 and 2017, ACRA conducted periodic reviews and removed from its public register, sole proprietorships and partnerships that failed to renew their registrations, and companies that were dormant.  These periodic removal of business entities took place at ad hoc intervals and impacted published statistics on business entities cessation.  The number of business entities cessation have therefore been adjusted to reflect the removal of such business entities at the date when they would have normally been removed.  Going forward, such review and removal exercises will be conducted on a regular basis to provide a more accurate reflection of cessation trends.",

The accompanying revision in the treatment of Asian Currency Units (ACUs) as resident units (which previously were treated as non?resident units) means that the coverage of Singapore's external assets and liabilities has been expanded to include those of the ACUs, resulting in increases in both Singapore's external assets and liabilities.  While the expansion of coverage has resulted in higher gross external debt (or liabilities), it has resulted also in higher external assets.  Singapore remains a net creditor, as the resulting increase in external assets is more than the increase in liabilities.  More information may be found in the Occasional Paper on \"\"Implementation of IMF Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition in Singapore's Balance of Payments\"\".",
