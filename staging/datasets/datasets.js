    "description": "Source : Derived based on data from Central Provident Fund Board\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\n1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",

    "description": "Source : Derived based on data from Central Provident Fund Board\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",

    "description": "Source: SINGAPORE DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS\r\n\r\nData Last Updated: 08/02/2024\r\n\r\nFootnotes: The weighting pattern for the 2019-based CPI was derived from expenditure values collected in the Household Expenditure Survey (HES) conducted between October 2017 and September 2018.  These expenditure values were updated to 2019 values by taking into account price changes between 2017/18 and 2019.  Household income group is based on ranking of resident households by their monthly household income from all sources (including imputed rental on owner-occupied accommodation).  This matrix is compiled on a half-yearly basis.  Data values for '1H' refers to CPI for the period January-June, and data values for '2H' refers to CPI for the period July-December.  For more information on the CPI rebasing, refer to the Information Paper 'Rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (2019 as Base Year)' (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/economy/ip-e48.pdf).\r\n\r\nAdapted from: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M213061",

    "description": "Source : Derived based on data from Central Provident Fund Board\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",

These expenditure values were updated to 2019 values by taking into account price changes between 2017/18 and 2019.  Household income group is based on ranking of resident households by their monthly household income from all sources (including imputed rental on owner-occupied accommodation).  This matrix is compiled on a half-yearly basis.  Data values for '1H' refers to CPI for the period January-June, and data values for '2H' refers to CPI for the period July-December.  For more information on the CPI rebasing, refer to the Information Paper 'Rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (2019 as Base Year)' (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/economy/ip-e48.pdf).\r\n\r\nAdapted from: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M213131",

    "description": "Source : Derived based on data from Central Provident Fund Board\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",

Should the graduates undertake more than one Degree (e.g. Dual Degree programme), they have been classified based on their first Degree.\r\n\r\n^  Data is based on a sample size of fewer than 30 respondents.\r\n\r\n\\**  No data is shown due to the small number of graduates and/or low response rates.\r\n\r\n\\#  Data on Law, Medical, Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences & Chinese Medicine graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated one year ago (e.g. for 2018 GES survey, data is obtained from 2017 graduates) after they have completed their one-year practical law course/pupillage/housemanship/first-year residency/practical training.  Data on Architecture graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 3 years ago (e.g. for 2018 GES survey, data is obtained from 2015 graduates) after they have completed their practical training.\r\n\r\n^^  Data includes the employment figures of graduates from Bachelor of Engineering (Bioengineering), which was merged into Bachelor of Engineering (Biomedical Engineering) in 2014.\r\n\r\n\\##  Data on NTU’s Medicine graduates will be obtained from a follow-up survey on the graduates after they have completed their housemanship/first-year residency.\r\n\r\n\\###  Data on SUTD's Bachelor of Science (Architecture and Sustainable Design) graduates will be obtained from a follow-up survey on the graduates after they have completed their practical training.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n**Disclaimer:**  \r\nThe data published is provided on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind.

The development charge has been reclassified from the 'Other Fees and Charges' to 'Other Taxes' category with effect from April 2009 to more accurately reflect its nature as a tax under Section 35 of the Planning Act.\r\n\r\nOther Fees and Charges include Licenses, Permits, Service Fees, Sales of Goods, Rental of Premises, Fines and Forfeitures and Reimbursements.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Constitutional amendments to protect 50% of Net Investment Income in FY2000, interest on development loans was classified as ‘Others’.",

    "description": "The residential rental index covers only private residential properties.  It does not cover HDB flats. \r\n\r\nThe rental index is computed from information obtained in returns filed with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).  When a property is let out, the property owner has to inform IRAS the details of the tenancy agreement. Besides an overall rental index for private residential properties, sub-indices for landed and non-landed properties are also compiled. From the 2015-Q1, a “stratified hedonic regression methodology” is used to compute the rental indices. Under this method, variations in the attributes of rental private properties transacted such as age and unit size are controlled for by using hedonic regression and rental movements are aggregated using 5-quarter fixed weights to derive the aggregate rental change.",

The accompanying revision in the treatment of Asian Currency Units (ACUs) as resident units (which previously were treated as non?resident units) means that the coverage of Singapore's external assets and liabilities has been expanded to include those of the ACUs, resulting in increases in both Singapore's external assets and liabilities.  While the expansion of coverage has resulted in higher gross external debt (or liabilities), it has resulted also in higher external assets.  Singapore remains a net creditor, as the resulting increase in external assets is more than the increase in liabilities.

Data on the number of Sub-sale and Resale units excludes en-bloc sale units and are collated from records submitted to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for stamp duty payments from 1Q2015. Prior to 1Q2015, Sub-sale and Resale data were compiled from caveats lodged to the Singapore Land Authority. As the latter (i.e. lodgment of caveats) is voluntary, caveats account for about 80 to 90% of all sub-sale and resale transactions. Hence, please note that data from 1Q2015 may not be directly comparable to figures in the previous quarters.",

    "description": "Source: ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE  REGULATORY AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nData Last Updated: 05/03/2024\r\n\r\nFootnotes: Due to a system issue in May 2023, there was a delay in the striking off process of companies and Limited Liability Partnerships.  The issue was rectified in Jun 2023 and ACRA has since resumed the standard processing time for striking off applications.  This has consequential effect on the published cessation statistics from Jul to Nov 2023.  Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the implementation of Circuit Breaker in Singapore from 7 Apr to 1 Jun 2020, ACRA had extended the time for relevant parties to respond to notices for the striking off applications by companies and limited liability partnerships.  This has a consequential effect on the published cessation statistics for Aug to Oct 2020.  ACRA has since resumed the standard processing time for striking off applications.  The statistics on business entities cessation till 2017 have been adjusted to provide a more accurate reflection of the underlying cessation trends.  In 2016 and 2017, ACRA conducted periodic reviews and removed from its public register, sole proprietorships and partnerships that failed to renew their registrations, and companies that were dormant.  These periodic removal of business entities took place at ad hoc intervals and impacted published statistics on business entities cessation.  The number of business entities cessation have therefore been adjusted to reflect the removal of such business entities at the date when they would have normally been removed.  Going forward, such review and removal exercises will be conducted on a regular basis to provide a more accurate reflection of cessation trends.\r\n\r\nAdapted from: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M085471",
