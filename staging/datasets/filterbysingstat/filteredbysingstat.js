These expenditure values were updated to 2019 values by taking into account price changes between 2017/18 and 2019.  Household income group is based on ranking of resident households by their monthly household income from all sources (including imputed rental on owner-occupied accommodation).  This matrix is compiled on a half-yearly basis.  Data values for '1H' refers to CPI for the period January-June, and data values for '2H' refers to CPI for the period July-December.  For more information on the CPI rebasing, refer to the Information Paper 'Rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (2019 as Base Year)' (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/economy/ip-e48.pdf).\r\n\r\nAdapted from: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M213061",

These expenditure values were updated to 2019 values by taking into account price changes between 2017/18 and 2019.  Household income group is based on ranking of resident households by their monthly household income from all sources (including imputed rental on owner-occupied accommodation).  This matrix is compiled on a half-yearly basis.  Data values for '1H' refers to CPI for the period January-June, and data values for '2H' refers to CPI for the period July-December.  For more information on the CPI rebasing, refer to the Information Paper 'Rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (2019 as Base Year)' (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/economy/ip-e48.pdf).\r\n\r\nAdapted from: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M213131",

    "description": "Source: SINGAPORE DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS\r\n\r\nData Last Updated: 29/12/2023\r\n\r\nFootnotes: With the implementation of the recommendations of the 6th Edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Manual (BPM6), Singapore's gross external debt is now reported on a BPM6 format.  The accompanying revision in the treatment of Asian Currency Units (ACUs) as resident units (which previously were treated as non?resident units) means that the coverage of Singapore's external assets and liabilities has been expanded to include those of the ACUs, resulting in increases in both Singapore's external assets and liabilities.  While the expansion of coverage has resulted in higher gross external debt (or liabilities), it has resulted also in higher external assets.  Singapore remains a net creditor, as the resulting increase in external assets is more than the increase in liabilities.  More information may be found in the Occasional Paper on \"\"Implementation of IMF Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition in Singapore's Balance of Payments\"\".\r\n\r\nAdapted from: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M060221",

The issue was rectified in Jun 2023 and ACRA has since resumed the standard processing time for striking off applications.  This has consequential effect on the published cessation statistics from Jul to Nov 2023.  Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the implementation of Circuit Breaker in Singapore from 7 Apr to 1 Jun 2020, ACRA had extended the time for relevant parties to respond to notices for the striking off applications by companies and limited liability partnerships.  This has a consequential effect on the published cessation statistics for Aug to Oct 2020.  ACRA has since resumed the standard processing time for striking off applications.  The statistics on business entities cessation till 2017 have been adjusted to provide a more accurate reflection of the underlying cessation trends.  In 2016 and 2017, ACRA conducted periodic reviews and removed from its public register, sole proprietorships and partnerships that failed to renew their registrations, and companies that were dormant.  These periodic removal of business entities took place at ad hoc intervals and impacted published statistics on business entities cessation.  The number of business entities cessation have therefore been adjusted to reflect the removal of such business entities at the date when they would have normally been removed.  Going forward, such review and removal exercises will be conducted on a regular basis to provide a more accurate reflection of cessation trends.\r\n\r\nAdapted from: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M085471",
